## Backtracking (Complete Search)

## Use Case

Enumerate all possible solutions

## Template

```python
def is_valid(candidate):
    # check if candidate is valid or not

def backtrack(path, <other state variables>):
    if <base case>:
        # update global result (i.e., append the path to the global result or increment the global result)
        return

    result = <initial value>
    for candidate in <input>:
        if not is_valid(candidate):
            continue
        # modify `path`
        result += backtrack(path, <other state variables>)
        # undo the modification to `path`

    return result
```

> [!NOTE]
> Backtracking can be visualized as a tree, where each node represents the current state of the path during a recursive function call. The `backtrack()` calls explore different branches of this tree, building potential solutions along the way. The leaves of the tree correspond to base cases, often representing complete solutions (but not in every problem).

## Complexity Analysis

Let \\(S\\) be number of possible states explored and \\(C\\) the cost of processing a single state. Then:
- Time Complexity: worst-case \\(O(S \cdot C)\\)
- Space Complexity: worst-case \\(O(d)\\) for the recursion stack, where \\(d\\) is the maximum depth of the recursion (i.e., the length of a complete `path`), excluding the space to store `path` itself or the accumulated results

> [!NOTE]
> Common values of \\(S\\) in the backtracking algorithm worst-case time complexity formula:
> - Combinations of \\(k\\) from \\(n\\): \\(\binom{n}{k}\\)
> - Permutations of from \\(n\\): \\(\frac{n!}{(n - k)!}\\)
> - Generic tree with branching factor \\(b\\) and depth \\(d\\): \\(b^d\\)
